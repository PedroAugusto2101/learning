# 04. PYTHON VARIABLES

## 04.00 Introduction to Variables

### What are Variables?
- Variables are used to store data in the computer's memory.
- They act as labels that point to data values.
- Defined using the `=` operator, which assigns a value to a name.

### Naming Variables
- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines:
  - Start with a lowercase letter.
  - Use numbers and underscores (`_`) if needed.
  - Avoid special characters and reserved words.

### Examples of Variable Assignment
```python
# Variable assignment
name = 'Pedro'
age = 22
is_adult = age >= 18

# Display variable values
print('Name:', name, 'Age:', age)
print('Is an adult?', is_adult)
```
