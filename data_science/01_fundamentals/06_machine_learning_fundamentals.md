# What is Machine Learning?

## 🔍 Definition

- Subfield of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables systems to **learn and improve** from experience **without explicit programming**.
- Uses algorithms trained on data to **detect patterns** — ML does **not create** patterns, it finds them.
- Algorithms analyze data, identify trends, and make **predictions or decisions** based on it.
- **Data is key**: the quality and quantity of data are essential to the model’s success.
- ML has existed for decades, but recent advances in **big data** and **computational power (e.g., GPUs)** have made it more powerful and precise.

## 🧠 What is Learning?

- Learning = the ability to **adapt, modify, and improve** behavior and responses — a fundamental human trait.
- ML aims to replicate human learning in machines.
- This is achieved through **math + programming**, the languages we use to communicate with computers.
- Strong foundations in **math** and **coding** are crucial to mastering ML.
- ML is a method of **data analysis** that automates building **analytical models** to find hidden patterns without being explicitly programmed for a specific task.

# Data Science vs. Machine Learning

## 🔗 Relationship

- **Closely related fields**, but not the same.
- **Data Science** is a broad field focused on **collecting, processing, analyzing, and interpreting** large volumes of data to extract insights and knowledge.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of AI that focuses on **developing algorithms and models** that learn from data to make predictions or decisions.
- ML provides the **tools and techniques** for **predictive analysis** and **pattern discovery** within Data Science.
- 👉 Every ML project is a **Data Science** project, but **not every** Data Science project involves ML.

# Types of Machine Learning

## ✅ Supervised Learning

- Algorithm is trained on **labeled data** (inputs and outputs are known).
- Goal: **learn a function** to map inputs to outputs and predict new data.
- All models make errors — the goal is to minimize the error.
- **Examples**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifiers.

## 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

- Algorithm is trained on **unlabeled data** (no predefined output).
- Goal: identify **hidden patterns or structures** (e.g., clusters or dimensionality reduction).
- Can be used to label data first, then apply supervised models.
- **Examples**: Clustering (e.g., K-Means), Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## 🎮 Reinforcement Learning

- Agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving **rewards or punishments**.
- Goal: **maximize cumulative reward** over time.
- **Examples**: Board games, robotic control, process optimization, trading bots.
