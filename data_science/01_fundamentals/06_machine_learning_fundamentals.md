# What is Machine Learning?

## 🔍 Definition

- Subfield of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables systems to **learn and improve** from experience **without explicit programming**.
- Uses algorithms trained on data to **detect patterns** — ML does **not create** patterns, it finds them.
- Algorithms analyze data, identify trends, and make **predictions or decisions** based on it.
- **Data is key**: the quality and quantity of data are essential to the model’s success.
- ML has existed for decades, but recent advances in **big data** and **computational power (e.g., GPUs)** have made it more powerful and precise.

## 🧠 What is Learning?

- Learning = the ability to **adapt, modify, and improve** behavior and responses — a fundamental human trait.
- ML aims to replicate human learning in machines.
- This is achieved through **math + programming**, the languages we use to communicate with computers.
- Strong foundations in **math** and **coding** are crucial to mastering ML.
- ML is a method of **data analysis** that automates building **analytical models** to find hidden patterns without being explicitly programmed for a specific task.
