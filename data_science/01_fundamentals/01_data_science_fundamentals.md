# Data Science Project Implementation

- Solving complex problems using:
    - Application of statistical methods;
    - Machine learning algorithms;
    - Analytical techniques.
- Different techniques, tools, and strategies can be used, but the overall process remains essentially the same.
- Not all stages are always present in a project; some steps may be skipped depending on the project's requirements.
- 7 core stages of a data science project:
    1. Define the problem;
    2. Collect and store data;
    3. Data cleaning and preprocessing;
    4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA);
    5. Predictive/statistical modeling (ML);
    6. Evaluation and testing;
    7. Delivering results.

# Problem Definition

- First, we must understand the business objective in question.
- Then, define the project's objectives.
- Identify research questions.
- Analyze available data (if data is not available, it must be gathered before starting the project).
- Define success metrics to determine when the project has achieved its goal.
- Plan the project accordingly.

# Data Collection and Storage

- Accurate data is the foundation for analysis and insights.
- Stakeholder involvement is crucial for defining data requirements.
- Various data collection methods:
    - Surveys
    - Interviews
    - Observations
    - Records
    - APIs
    - Public databases
- Ensuring data quality is fundamental.
- Data cleaning and validation techniques help maintain data integrity and accuracy.
    - Data Scientists can process the data after retrieval.
    - Data Engineers can pre-process data in data pipelines.
- Efficient and secure data storage is crucial:
    - Relational databases;
    - Data lakes;
    - Data warehouses.
- Protecting data is essential:
    - Implement security measures such as encryption, access control, and privacy policies.
- Data collection and storage are typically the responsibility of Data Engineers, but understanding the process is valuable if no dedicated engineer is available.

# Data Preparation and Cleaning

- Data almost always requires cleaning and processing.
- Preparation involves transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling:
    - Cleaning:
        - Removing null values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
        - Normalizing and standardizing data.
    - Transformation:
        - Converting data into appropriate formats for analysis.
        - Aggregation, encoding, and creating new variables.
    - Integration/Combination:
        - Merging data from different sources.
        - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is frequently used to consolidate data from various systems.
    - Encoding:
        - Converting text variables into numerical values.
        - Modifying data without altering its information content.
    - Reduction:
        - Reducing large and complex datasets while retaining the most relevant information.
        - Feature selection - PCA (Principal Component Analysis) helps reduce complexity and improves analysis efficiency.
- Data = raw material; Information = structured data; Knowledge = interpretation and application of information to generate value.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Initial analysis of data to understand its characteristics and patterns.
- Uses statistical and descriptive techniques, visualization tools, and identifies relationships between variables while detecting outliers.
- Helps analysts and scientists formulate hypotheses, choose appropriate processing methods, and prevent errors.
- Data visualization aids in preliminary analysis and generating insights.
- Clear and informative visual representations facilitate understanding for non-technical stakeholders such as managers, directors, and executives.

# Key Differences Between Predictive and Statistical Modeling

## 1. Objective

### Statistical Modeling
- Focuses on understanding relationships between variables, identifying patterns, and making inferences about populations.
- Aims to establish causal or associative relationships and test hypotheses.

### Predictive Modeling
- Aims to predict future values or outcomes based on historical data.
- Prioritizes prediction accuracy over interpretability.

## 2. Approach

### Statistical Modeling
- **Methods:** Linear regression, ANOVA, hypothesis testing.
- **Assumptions:** Data follows specific distributions (e.g., normality), and there is an assumed relationship between variables.

### Predictive Modeling
- **Methods:** 
  - **Supervised Learning:** Decision trees, neural networks, SVM.
  - **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering.
- **Assumptions:** Vary by algorithm, with a focus on predictive performance.

## 3. Interpretation

### Statistical Modeling
- Results are interpretable, allowing causal inference.
- **Output:** Coefficients, confidence intervals, p-values.

### Predictive Modeling
- Interpretation is often difficult.
- **Output:** Accuracy, AUC, precision, recall.

---

## 4. Applications

### Statistical Modeling
- Hypothesis testing (e.g., drug effectiveness).
- Market research (e.g., relationship between demographics and buying behavior).

### Predictive Modeling
- Business: Sales forecasting, fraud detection.
- Engineering: Machine failure prediction, preventive maintenance.

## 5. Tools & Techniques

### Statistical Modeling
- **Tools:** R, Stata, SAS, SPSS, Python (Statsmodels).
- **Techniques:** Linear/logistic regression, ANOVA, survival analysis, factor analysis.

### Predictive Modeling
- **Tools:** Python (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow), R (caret, randomForest), Julia, Rust, C++, Java.
- **Techniques:** Decision trees, random forests, deep learning, boosting, bagging, regression.

# Evaluation and Testing

Essential steps to ensure model reliability and performance.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE).
- **Cross-Validation:** Splits data into multiple training/testing sets to validate generalization.
- **Overfitting & Underfitting:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise; underfitting happens when it oversimplifies patterns.
- **Learning Curves:** Graphs showing model performance as training progresses, helping identify over/underfitting.
- **Error Analysis (Residuals):** Examines the difference between predictions and actual values to detect patterns or biases.
- **Benchmarking:** Compares model performance against existing solutions or baselines.

# Delivering Results

The format varies based on objectives and target audience. The deliverable is defined during the project planning phase.

### Possible Deliverables:
1. **Technical or Scientific Report** – Detailed documentation of methodology and findings.  
2. **Executive Report** – High-level summary for decision-makers.  
3. **Interactive Dashboard or Infographic** – Visual representation of insights with storytelling.  
4. **Jupyter Notebook** – Code-based report with explanations and outputs.  
5. **Source Code & Documentation** – Scripts and manuals for implementation.  
6. **API (Application Programming Interface)** – Enables integration with other systems.  
7. **Web Application for Model Deployment** – Provides a user-friendly interface for model interaction.  
8. **ML Model Predictions in a CSV File** – Structured output for further analysis.  
9. **ML Model Predictions in a Database** – Stores results for easy access and querying.
