# Definition of Data Science

- Interdisciplinary field (involves knowledge from other areas);
- Uses methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data;
- Uses techniques from statistics, machine learning, data analysis, and programming → to solve problems and support decision-making;
- Aims to solve business problems;
- The company needs raw material: data
    - If there is not enough data to generate intelligent insights and analysis, data science cannot be applied.

# Knowledge Areas

- Mathematics and Statistics;
    - Techniques and procedures for calculation, analysis, correlation, transformation, cleaning, and interpretation of data;
- Computer Science;
    - Computer programming, storage, parallel processing, and optimization of analysis process execution time;
- Business Knowledge;
    - The goal of data science is to solve business problems, and domain knowledge (business area) is essential to interpret data and analysis results.
- In other words, data science uses automated methods (Computer Science) to analyze (Mathematics and Statistics) large amounts of data to extract knowledge (business areas) from them.

# The Importance of Science in Data Science

- The most important part of data science is science;
- It involves applied techniques and scientific methods to solve problems using computing;
- In data science, we work to solve business problems;
- Keywords in data science:
    - Problem Solving;
    - Scientific Method;
    - Mathematics;
    - Statistics;
    - Computing;
    - Visualization;
    - Data Engineering;
    - Business Knowledge.

# Data and Decision Making

- Our primary goal in DS is to convert data into decisions, which then lead to actions;
- Example:
    - "Customers cancel their phone plans frequently within 2 to 3 months after signing up."
    1. Data and Analysis - Collected data led to the conclusion that there is a trend among telecom customers to switch operators after the third customer service contact;
    2. Decision - Executives decided, based on data, to review customer service processes;
    3. Action - The company hires a consulting firm to provide specialized customer service training.
- The main objective of Data Science → extract information from data and transform it into knowledge, which can then be used for decision-making.

# The Data-Driven Process

- Data-driven process → moving from raw data to action;
- The first question is identifying the problem: "What happened?";
- The next question comes after analyzing the data: "Why did it happen?";
- The following question can be answered using machine learning: "Will it happen again?";
- Then, we engage directly with managers: "What should be done?";
- Finally, a decision is made, adding value to the company.

# Ethics in Data Science

- **Responsibility and Transparency**
    - Data scientists should be transparent about the algorithms they use, explaining how data is collected and analyzed;
    - Document the analysis process and provide clear justifications for decisions made.
- **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**
    - Avoid biases in data and algorithms that could lead to unfair decisions;
    - Promote equal opportunities, ensuring that AI systems do not perpetuate existing inequalities.
- **Informed Consent**
    - Individuals should be informed about how their data will be used and give explicit consent for data collection and usage;
    - Consent should be obtained clearly and understandably, without ambiguity.
- **Beneficence and Non-Maleficence**
    - Ensure that analyses bring benefits and avoid causing harm to individuals or groups involved;
    - Consider social and ethical impacts of data-based analyses and decisions.

# Privacy in Data Science

- **Personal Data Protection**
    - Personal data should be protected from unauthorized access, leaks, and other security risks;
    - Anonymization and pseudonymization methods can be used to protect individuals' identities.
- **Regulatory Compliance**
    - Adherence to applicable privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) in Brazil;
    - Laws that establish clear guidelines for data collection, processing, storage, and sharing.
- **Data Minimization**
    - Avoid excessive data collection;
    - Only collect the data necessary for a specific analysis.
- **Data Subject Rights**
    - Individuals have the right to access, correct, and delete their personal data;
    - Easy means should be provided for individuals to exercise these rights.

# Career Perspectives in Data Science

- **Data Scientist** - focuses more on statistics and machine learning;
- **Data Analyst** - entry-level role, focused on data visualization and analysis without heavy AI and statistical techniques;
- **Data Engineer** - oriented toward data and technology infrastructure;
- **Machine Learning Engineer** - focused on developing and deploying machine learning models;
- **AI Engineer** - an advanced evolution of the data scientist, with enhanced artificial intelligence techniques;
- **DataOps Engineer** - responsible for keeping everything running, a natural evolution of the data engineer;
- **Analytics Engineer** - a professional who can analyze data and maintain data infrastructure;
- **Data Architect** - designs ETL processes, similar to an engineer (who executes), but the architect focuses more on planning;
- **RPA Architect** - specialized in automating company processes.

# Data Science Project Implementation

- Solving complex problems using:
    - Application of statistical methods;
    - Machine learning algorithms;
    - Analytical techniques.
- It is possible to use different techniques, tools, and strategies, but the overall process remains essentially the same;
- This means that not all steps are always present in a project, and some steps may be skipped depending on the project requirements.
- 7 core stages of a data science project:
    1. Define the problem;
    2. Collect and store data;
    3. Data preprocessing and cleaning;
    4. Exploratory data analysis (EDA);
    5. Predictive/statistical modeling (ML);
    6. Evaluation and testing;
    7. Delivering results.

# Problem Definition

- We must first understand the business objective;
- Then, we define the project objectives;
- Identify research questions;
- Analyze available data (if there is no data, it is necessary to obtain it before starting the project);
- Define success metrics – to determine when success is achieved;
- Project planning.
