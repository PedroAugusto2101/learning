# What is the Data Science Project Lifecycle?

- Refers to the **systematic process** through which a data science project is **conceived, developed, and completed**.
- Requires a **business problem** and **raw data** as key inputs.
- Involves **critical stages** that help transform raw data into **valuable insights**.
- Includes the following **key phases**:

## Defining the Business Problem

- Ensure the problem is **feasible** to solve.
- The solution must be **achievable** with the available company data.
- Although multiple problems can be tackled simultaneously, it is **not recommended**.
- Clearly **identify the problem** and define **specific objectives**.
- Always align the problem with the **company's strategic goals**.

## Data Collection and Preparation

- Data is collected from **various sources**, both **internal and external**.
- The preparation phase includes **data cleaning, processing, and transformation**.
- This stage typically involves **data engineers** to ensure data quality and structure.

## Data Exploration and Analysis

- Raw data may lack **clear patterns**, requiring **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- **Statistical techniques** and **data visualization** are used to identify **trends, patterns, and anomalies**.
- This step is crucial for **hypothesis formulation** and **modeling strategies**.
- **Data visualization** plays a key role in uncovering insights and guiding decisions.

## Predictive/Statistical Modeling

- **Statistical models** or **machine learning algorithms** are developed and trained using **prepared data**.
- Different **versions of a model** can be created using techniques such as **hyperparameter optimization** and **cross-validation**.
- Experimentation with various **algorithms** is conducted to achieve the **desired accuracy or performance metric**.
- Iteration is common: revisiting previous steps like **data cleaning or exploratory analysis** may be necessary to improve results.

## Model Evaluation

- Crucial for determining the **accuracy and effectiveness** of the model in making predictions or classifications.
- Each algorithm or approach requires **specific evaluation metrics** (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.).
- If performance is poor, it may be necessary to **reassess the business problem** or the **available data**.
- Generally, as **data volume increases**, model performance tends to improve.
- **Decision-making and justification** are key components of a data science project.

## Model Deployment and Implementation

- Approved models are **deployed into production**.
- Deployment may involve **integration with existing IT systems**, either in **cloud environments** or **on-premises** (local company network).
- Models can be executed to generate **direct results**, which may be delivered through:
  - An **API** exposing model predictions.
  - Feeding **business intelligence tools** like Power BI.
  - Other **automated data pipelines**.
- The **deliverable is defined** in the initial **problem definition phase**.
- If deployment includes a **web application**, it should be treated as a **separate project**, as it requires additional expertise beyond the scope of a data scientist.

# Communicating Results and Storytelling

- **Technical skills** are essential, but **soft skills**, such as communication, are **indispensable** in data science.
- Effective communication ensures that **results are understood** by stakeholders, including business teams and clients.
- **Storytelling** is key: narrating the **entire process**, justifying **decisions**, and presenting **findings** in a compelling way.
- Ideally, results should be communicated **within 15 minutes** to maintain engagement and avoid distractions.

# Data Science Project Deliverables    

## Types of Deliverables  

- **Reports** → Summarized conclusions from a model presented in a structured report.  
- **Charts and Dashboards** → Visual representation of results for better interpretation.  
- **Statistical/Predictive Models** → In some cases, the model itself is the deliverable.  
- **Insight Presentation** → A structured presentation focusing on insights derived from the models.  
- **Recommendation System or Data App** → More complex; tools like Streamlit can be used to develop interactive applications.
