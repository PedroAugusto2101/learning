# What is the Data Science Project Lifecycle?

- Refers to the **systematic process** through which a data science project is **conceived, developed, and completed**.
- Requires a **business problem** and **raw data** as key inputs.
- Involves **critical stages** that help transform raw data into **valuable insights**.
- Includes the following **key phases**:

## Defining the Business Problem

- Ensure the problem is **feasible** to solve.
- The solution must be **achievable** with the available company data.
- Although multiple problems can be tackled simultaneously, it is **not recommended**.
- Clearly **identify the problem** and define **specific objectives**.
- Always align the problem with the **company's strategic goals**.

## Data Collection and Preparation

- Data is collected from **various sources**, both **internal and external**.
- The preparation phase includes **data cleaning, processing, and transformation**.
- This stage typically involves **data engineers** to ensure data quality and structure.

## Data Exploration and Analysis

- Raw data may lack **clear patterns**, requiring **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- **Statistical techniques** and **data visualization** are used to identify **trends, patterns, and anomalies**.
- This step is crucial for **hypothesis formulation** and **modeling strategies**.
- **Data visualization** plays a key role in uncovering insights and guiding decisions.

## Predictive/Statistical Modeling

- **Statistical models** or **machine learning algorithms** are developed and trained using **prepared data**.
- Different **versions of a model** can be created using techniques such as **hyperparameter optimization** and **cross-validation**.
- Experimentation with various **algorithms** is conducted to achieve the **desired accuracy or performance metric**.
- Iteration is common: revisiting previous steps like **data cleaning or exploratory analysis** may be necessary to improve results.
