# SQL and Queries for Data Analysis  

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is used to **manage and manipulate relational databases**. It is essential for:  
- **Inserting, querying, updating, and managing data**.  
- **Extracting insights from large datasets**.  
- **Supporting Data Warehouses and ETL processes**.  
- **Variations include HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and CQL (Cassandra Query Language)**.  
- **Can be integrated with Python and R for advanced analysis**.  

## SQL Query Examples  

```sql
SELECT nome, idade FROM tb_usuarios WHERE idade > 18;
```
```sql
SELECT nome, salario FROM tb_funcionarios ORDER BY salario DESC;
```
```sql
SELECT DATE(data_venda) AS dia, SUM(valor)
FROM tb_vendas
WHERE data_venda BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'
GROUP BY dia;
```
