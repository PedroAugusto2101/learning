# Data Science vs. Statistics

- They are distinct concepts.  
- Statistics provides the theoretical foundation and essential techniques for data science projects.  
- Data Science extends beyond statistics, incorporating programming, data engineering, and machine learning.  

# Definition of Statistics by the American Statistical Association (ASA)

- Recognizes the integration between statistics and data science.  
- States that statistics is a core component of data science, alongside database management and distributed computing systems.  

# What is Statistics?

- A field that collects, organizes, analyzes, interprets, and presents data to support decision-making.  
- Uses mathematical methods to summarize information and infer population characteristics from samples.  
- Helps understand phenomena and predict behaviors.  

# Main Categories of Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics

- Simplest form of statistics.  
- Helps summarize data (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).  
- Used in data analysis, data science projects, and ML preprocessing.  
- Focuses on summarizing and describing key aspects of a dataset.  

## Inferential Statistics

- More advanced techniques.  
- Uses a sample to make inferences about a population.  
- Involves making predictions or conclusions about a population based on a sample.  

# Fundamental Statistical Concepts - Overview

- **Population**: The complete set of items or events of interest.  
- **Sample**: A subset of the population.  
- **Quantitative Variables**: Numeric variables representing measurements or counts.  
- **Qualitative Variables**: Categorical variables that describe characteristics.  
- **Correlation**: Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.  
- **Regression**: Analyzes the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
- **Probability**: Quantifies uncertainty and serves as the foundation for inferential statistics.
