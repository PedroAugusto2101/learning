# Data Science vs. Statistics

- They are distinct concepts.  
- Statistics provides the theoretical foundation and essential techniques for data science projects.  
- Data Science extends beyond statistics, incorporating programming, data engineering, and machine learning.  

# Definition of Statistics by the American Statistical Association (ASA)

- Recognizes the integration between statistics and data science.  
- States that statistics is a core component of data science, alongside database management and distributed computing systems.  

# What is Statistics?

- A field that collects, organizes, analyzes, interprets, and presents data to support decision-making.  
- Uses mathematical methods to summarize information and infer population characteristics from samples.  
- Helps understand phenomena and predict behaviors.  

# Main Categories of Statistics

## Descriptive Statistics

- Simplest form of statistics.  
- Helps summarize data (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).  
- Used in data analysis, data science projects, and ML preprocessing.  
- Focuses on summarizing and describing key aspects of a dataset.  

## Inferential Statistics

- More advanced techniques.  
- Uses a sample to make inferences about a population.  
- Involves making predictions or conclusions about a population based on a sample.  

# Fundamental Statistical Concepts

## Overview

- **Population**: The complete set of items or events of interest.  
- **Sample**: A subset of the population.  
- **Quantitative Variables**: Numerical variables representing measurements or counts.  
- **Qualitative Variables**: Categorical variables describing characteristics.  
- **Correlation**: Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.  
- **Regression**: Analysis describing the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  
- **Probability**: Quantifies uncertainty and is the foundation of inferential statistics.  

## Population vs. Sample

- **Population**: The entire set of individuals/elements sharing a common characteristic.  
- **Sample**: A subset selected for analysis to infer characteristics about the entire population.  
  - Must be representative to ensure valid conclusions.  
  - Sampling techniques are used to achieve representativeness.  
- **Why not analyze the entire population?**  
  - Cost  
  - Time  
  - Necessity  

## Parameters vs. Statistics

- **Parameters**: Characteristics of the population, calculated using population data.  
- **Statistics**: Characteristics of the sample, calculated using sample data.  
- **Example**:  
  - Sample statistic: Percentage of people in a sample who prefer brand X shoes.  
  - Population parameter: Estimated percentage of the entire population who prefer brand X shoes.  

## Primary vs. Secondary Data

- **Data vs. Information**:  
  - **Data**: Collected values from observations or measurements.  
    - Example: The number "23" (data).  
  - **Information**: Processed data providing relevant insights.  
    - Example: "23 years old" (information).  
- **Data Sources**:  
  - **Primary Data**: Collected by the analyst.  
    - More reliable, greater control.  
  - **Secondary Data**: Collected by third parties.  
    - Less reliable, less control.  
- **Most real-world data analysis relies on secondary data**, processed to generate valuable insights.  

## Observations vs. Variables

- **Observation**: A recorded instance of a dataset unit (e.g., a row in a table).  
- **Variable**: A measured characteristic of a population or sample (e.g., a column in a table).  

## Types of Variables

- **Qualitative Variables** (Categorical):  
  - **Nominal**: No specific order (e.g., profession, gender, religion).  
  - **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., education level: high school, bachelor's, master's).  
- **Quantitative Variables** (Numerical):  
  - **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of children, number of cars).  
  - **Continuous**: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight, salary).  
- **Example**:  
  - "Age" as a number (11, 15, 18) → **Quantitative**.  
  - "Age group" (0-5 years, 6-12 years) → **Qualitative (Ordinal)**.  
- **Why classify variables correctly?**  
  - Helps choose the appropriate statistical test.  
  - May require transformations for machine learning models.  

## Probability Theory

- **Deals with quantifying uncertainty**, providing a mathematical framework to understand complex systems and random phenomena.  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - **Random Experiment**: A process with an unpredictable outcome (e.g., flipping a coin, rolling a die).  
  - **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes (e.g., {heads, tails} for a coin flip).  
  - **Event**: A subset of outcomes within the sample space.  
    - Simple: Getting "heads

# Relationship Between Data Science and Statistics

- **Statistics provides theoretical foundations**, while data science expands these foundations with new technologies and techniques to handle massive volumes of data.  
- **Applications in Data Science:**  
    1. **Data Exploration**  
        - **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Understanding data structures, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies.  
    2. **Data-Driven Decision Making**  
    3. **Complementary Skills**

# How to Learn Statistics for Data Science?

# Importance of Statistical Inference in Data Science Projects

## What is Statistical Inference?

- Uses sample data to draw conclusions about a population  
- Helps scientists generalize findings to a broader population  
- In summary: extracting conclusions from datasets  

## Basic Principles of Statistical Inference

1. **Understanding the Population & Sampling** – Identify the population of interest and collect a representative sample to ensure generalizable conclusions.  
2. **Data Collection** – Gather sample data through experiments, surveys, or observational studies (sampling techniques).  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyze data structure, detect outliers, check normality, etc., before making inferences.  
4. **Parameter Estimation** – Compute numerical measures summarizing population characteristics (mean, proportion, standard deviation, etc.). Use **point estimates** and **confidence intervals** derived from samples.  
5. **Hypothesis Testing** – A method to make statistical inferences by generalizing from a sample to a population.  
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** Assumes no significant effect, difference, or relationship between variables. Any observed difference is due to randomness or sampling error.  
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ):** Opposes the null hypothesis, suggesting a significant effect, difference, or relationship exists. Indicates observed variations result from a real phenomenon.  
6. **Significance Level & P-Value** – The probability of rejecting H₀ when it is true.  
   - **P-value:** The probability of obtaining an extreme result under the assumption that H₀ is true.
