# 00. SUPERVISED LEARNING

## 00.00 Introduction

- **Definition**: Supervised learning uses **labeled data**, meaning each input comes with a known output.
- **Goal**: Learn a mapping from inputs (features) to outputs (labels) in order to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

## 00.01 Key Concepts

- **Training Process**:
  - The model is trained on a **dataset containing input-output pairs**.
  - It learns by minimizing the **error** between predicted outputs and actual labels.

### Types of Problems

- **Classification**:
  - Predicts discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam).
- **Regression**:
  - Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).

## 00.02 Example Use Cases

- Email Filtering: Classifying emails as spam or not.

- Medical Diagnosis: Predicting diseases based on symptoms or lab results.

- Sales Forecasting: Estimating future sales based on historical data.
