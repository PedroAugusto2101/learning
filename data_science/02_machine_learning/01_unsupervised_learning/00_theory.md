# 00. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

## 00.00 Introduction

- **Definition**: Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with **unlabeled data**, meaning there are **no correct answers** provided.
- **Goal**: Discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships in the data **without guidance**.

## 00.01 Key Concepts

- **Pattern Discovery**: The algorithm identifies interesting structures in the data, such as:
  - **Distance-based clustering**: Grouping data points based on proximity (e.g., using Euclidean distance).
  - **Dimensionality reduction**: Simplifying high-dimensional data while preserving its structure.

### Example Use Cases

- **Google News**: Groups related news articles using similarity metrics.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering customers to apply targeted strategies and personalized recommendations.

### Core Techniques

- **Clustering**:
  - Groups data into clusters based on feature similarity.
  - Common algorithms: `K-Means`, `DBSCAN`, `Hierarchical Clustering`.
