    "## **What is NumPy?**\n",
    "- NumPy is a **linear algebra library for Python**.\n",
    "- It serves as the **foundation** for many other data analysis libraries.\n",
    "- **Highly optimized and fast**, as its core functions are implemented in **C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **NumPy Arrays**\n",
    "- One of the **most powerful tools** in NumPy.\n",
    "- Can be visualized in two primary forms:\n",
    "  - **Vectors**: **1D arrays**, containing a single row or column of elements.\n",
    "  - **Matrices**: **2D arrays**, which can have multiple rows and columns (even if they contain only one row or column).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why Use NumPy?**\n",
    "- Efficient handling of **large datasets**.\n",
    "- **Optimized performance** compared to Python lists.\n",
    "- Essential for **scientific computing**, machine learning, and data analysis.\n"
